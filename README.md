# CV7OEMFR Library for Arduino
With this library, you can retrieve data from NMEA0183 frames. Of type **$IIMWV** and **$WIXDR** with a ultrasonic anemometer (CV7OEMFR). 

The sensor comes from the lcjcapteur company. You can access it with this link : https://lcjcapteurs.com/girouette-anemometres-capteur-vent/cv7-oem-2/

## Connection
if you want to use my library with an **Ultrasonic Anemometer** and an **ESP32** to send the data. You can hook it up like this :

## How to download
### download locally

You can download the library locally from GitHub with this link: https://github.com/MaximeLBG/CV7OEMFR
After you have downloaded this library. You must extract the compressed file (.zip) in the arduino library on your computer. The default path is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries\".

### download Online
Otherwise you can download from arduino's library manager. To do this, in Arduino you have to go to "sketch", "include a library", "manage libraries" and search the library by the name "CV7OEMFR".

## Example
Once the installation is complete. If you want to directly add the library to your code. Go to "sketch", "include a library" and choose "CV7OEMFR". 
Otherwise if you want to use an example file go to "file", "examples", "CV7OEMFR" and select "CV7OEMFR".

## More information
I created this library in partnership with the high school *Charles de Foucault* in *Nancy*, **France**. They gave me the materials to use. In particular an ultrasonic anemometer.
